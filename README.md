# Project

## 18th International Conference on the European Energy Market (EEM)
This is my first capstone project in microverse and it's about EEM.
The International Conference on European Energy Markets (EEM) is one of the well established conferences in
Europe,which has been bringing together experts from the fields of science, industry and politics, to present and discuss a wide range of themes related to energy markets for the last 18 years. These include approaches and solutions for issues
related to modelling, market design, regulatory policies, climate change etc. An important focal point are
discussions on the changes that the energy sector is expected to undergo in short and long term, and the challenges this
presents. The EEM is a common platform where challenges, solutions and ideas are shared between representatives from
the many fields of which (European) energy markets consist.
